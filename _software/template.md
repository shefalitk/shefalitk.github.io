[`gridparse`](https://github.com/gchochla/gridparse) is a lightweight (only dependency is `omegaconf` which also downloads yaml) `ArgumentParser` - aka `GridArgumentParser` - that supports your grid-search needs. Supports top-level parser and subparsers. Configuration files of any type (using `omegaconf`) are also supported through the argument `--gridparse-config` (also available with underscore `_`), where multiple configuration files can be passed and parsed.

To install: `pip install gridparse`
