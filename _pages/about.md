Welcome üëã! My name is Shefali.

I am a *Computer Science Ph.D. student* at the *University of Southern California* and a graduate research assistant at the [Analysis of Network Traffic lab](https://ant.isi.edu), supervised by Dr. [John Heidemann](https://ant.isi.edu/~johnh/). I am currently interested and actively publishing on Internet Measurement, Mobile Networks and using DNN for solving Network Issues. 

Previously, I studied M.Tech (MS) üñ•Ô∏è in Computer Network Engineering at the *National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru, Karnataka, India* (NIE), BE in Electronics and Communication Engg at *Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, India.* 
I did research on Auto-Triage for systems as part of my masters diploma [thesis] under the supervision of prof. [Prajakta M] and Mrs. Bhargavi Kondaveeti, where I developed a debugging system for Enterprise storage. 
For my under graduate thesis, I worked on a AI driven anti-missile-system supervied by Dr. D.J Ravi.

Beyond ML and CS, I find great pleasure in singing, painting and discussing Indian Philosophy, Astronomy, and most other sciences.
