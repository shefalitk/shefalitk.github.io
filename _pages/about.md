Welcome 👋! You have wandered into my personal website. Here, you will find the latest and greatest news on moi. My name is Georgios Chochlakis. I have a M.Eng in Electrical ⚡ & Computer 🖥️ Engineering from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). My major was in Computer Science [Computer Software (L), Computer Systems (Y) and Signals, Control & Robotics (S) flows]. I did research on Deep Learning algorithms as part of my undergraduate diploma [thesis](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/17793), where I examined generative models in a [Zero-shot Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) setting.

Broadly, I am interested in Computer Vision 👀, Generative modeling 🖼️, Reinforcement Learning 🤯, Conversational AI 🗣️, and their applications in Embodied AI and Robotics 🦿. I am also interested in mathematically principled Machine Learning 🔍 (Learning theory, optimization, etc).

Currently, I am a ML engineer at [Behavioral Signal Technologies](https://behavioralsignals.com/), working on Speech Diarization in telephone calls. 

You can also catch me at my Machine Learning blog, [*Thinking AIoud*](https://thinking-ai-aloud.blogspot.com/) 💭, where I examine basic Machine and Deep Learning concepts in depth.
